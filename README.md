Timed trivia game 
I created a timed trivia game that consists of 5 questions. 
When the user clicks the start button at the beginning the first question will come up and a timer of 15 seconds will start running. 
User has a total of 15 seconds to pick their answer from the multiple choice answers. 
If the user answers on time it will alert them if their answer is correct or incorrent.
If user fails to pick an answer before the timer ends it will automcatically say wrong and move to the next question.
After going through all five questions, user gets to see how many questions they answered correctly or incorrectly.
